VHDL code for a game that is played as follows: The computer generates a random hex number from 0-F when
a button is pressed. This number will be displayed on a 7-segment display and the user must flip all, some
or no swi tches to match this value as a binary nibble. A switch up is a 1 and a switch down is a 0. This
speed at which this inp ut will then be graded and this grade will then be displayed on a second 7-segment
display. A = response less than or e qual to 2 seconds. B = response greater than 2 but less than or equal
to 3 seconds. C = response greater than 3 but les s than or equal to 4 seconds. D = response greater than 4
but less than or equal to 5 seconds. F = response greater tha n 5 seconds but less than or equal to 6 seconds.
